Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Product Name

Decision Memory System (DMS)
(working name — can be changed)

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this system is to capture, persist, and make searchable the reasoning (“WHY”) behind GitHub Pull Requests, independent of PR descriptions, comments, or external documentation.

The system ensures that engineering decisions are not lost over time, even after PRs are merged, contributors leave, or discussions disappear.

1.2 Problem Statement

In modern software development:

Decisions are discussed in PRs, Slack, meetings

PR descriptions are unstructured and buried

Documentation becomes outdated

Teams repeatedly re-debate the same choices

New developers lack context for existing code

There is no system that treats decisions as first-class, queryable entities tied to code changes.

1.3 Scope

This system:

Integrates with GitHub

Tracks Pull Requests

Associates structured decision records with PRs

Maintains decision history across the PR lifecycle

This system does not replace GitHub, nor does it block GitHub workflows.

2. User Roles
2.1 Repository Owner

Authenticates via GitHub

Imports repositories

Manages project visibility

Can view all decisions

2.2 Contributor

GitHub user who raises PRs

Can write and edit decision records for their PRs

Can view decisions for the repositories they contribute to

2.3 Viewer (Read-only)

Can search and read decisions

Cannot create or modify decisions

MongoDB is the system of record.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Authentication & Authorization
FR-1: GitHub Authentication

The system SHALL authenticate users using GitHub OAuth.

Only GitHub-authenticated users may access the system.

FR-2: Access Control

Users SHALL only see repositories they own or contribute to.

Authorization SHALL be derived from GitHub data.

4.2 Repository Management
FR-3: Repository Import

The system SHALL allow users to import GitHub repositories.

Each imported repository SHALL be represented as a Project.

FR-4: Contributor Discovery

The system SHALL automatically list contributors based on GitHub PR data.

Manual user invitations SHALL NOT be required.

4.3 Pull Request Tracking
FR-5: PR Detection

The system SHALL listen to GitHub pull_request webhooks.

On pull_request.opened, a PR record SHALL be created.

FR-6: PR Status Sync

The system SHALL track PR states:

OPEN

MERGED

CLOSED (not merged)

Webhook events SHALL be the source of truth.

4.4 Decision Management (Core Feature)
FR-7: Decision Creation

For each PR, the system SHALL allow creation of a Decision Record containing:

WHAT (summary of change)

WHY (reasoning)

OPTIONS_CONSIDERED

TRADEOFFS

AUTHOR

TIMESTAMP

FR-8: Decision State

Each PR SHALL have a decision state:

PENDING

DOCUMENTED

FR-9: Decision Visibility

Decision records SHALL be visible independently of PR state.

Decisions SHALL remain accessible after PR merge or closure.

4.5 PR Lifecycle Rules
PR Event	PR Status	Decision Status
PR opened	OPEN	PENDING
Decision written	OPEN	DOCUMENTED
PR merged	MERGED	DOCUMENTED or PENDING
PR closed	CLOSED	OPTIONAL

If a PR is merged while the decision is still PENDING, the system SHALL flag it as “Merged without documented decision”.

4.6 Search & Discovery
FR-10: Decision Search

The system SHALL support search by:

Keywords

Repository

Author

Date range

FR-11: Decision History

Decisions SHALL maintain an edit history.

Previous versions SHALL remain accessible.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Performance

Webhook processing SHALL complete within 2 seconds.

Search results SHALL return within 500ms for typical datasets.

5.2 Scalability

The system SHALL support multiple repositories per user.

The system SHALL be horizontally scalable.

5.3 Reliability

GitHub webhooks SHALL be idempotent.

Duplicate events SHALL NOT create duplicate records.

5.4 Security

OAuth tokens SHALL be encrypted at rest.

Webhook payloads SHALL be verified via GitHub signatures.

6. Data Model (Logical)
6.1 Project

id

github_repo_id

name

owner

visibility

6.2 PullRequest

id

project_id

github_pr_number

title

author

status

created_at

merged_at

6.3 Decision

id

pull_request_id

what

why

options

tradeoffs

author

version

created_at

updated_at

7. External Integrations
7.1 GitHub

OAuth

Repositories API

Pull Requests API (initial sync only)

Webhooks (pull_request)

7.2 Localization (Optional, Non-Core)

Human-readable decision text MAY be localized using
Lingo.dev
to support multilingual teams via PR-based translation workflows.

Localization SHALL NOT affect system logic.

8. Constraints & Assumptions
8.1 Constraints

GitHub remains the source of truth for PR lifecycle.

The system SHALL NOT block PR merges.

8.2 Assumptions

Decision authors are humans.

AI SHALL NOT invent decision intent.

9. Out of Scope

Code review automation

PR approval enforcement

AI-generated decisions

File-level code analysis

10. Success Criteria

The system is successful if:

Teams can answer “Why does this exist?” months later

New developers ramp up faster

Decision reasoning survives PR lifecycle

No additional burden is placed on GitHub workflows

One-line Summary

This product creates long-term memory for engineering decisions without disrupting how developers already work.
